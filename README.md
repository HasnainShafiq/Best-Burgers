# Best-Burgers

## Edited on 06/06/2022

This was one of my earliest projects which was an excuse to fiddle around with TailwindCSS. It isn't my best piece of work but it serves to show where I started from and is a good first project to compare my most recent projects with. Being one of my earliest pieces of work, it was a bit of a steep learning curve, which required me to read through the Tailwind docs extensively and to tackle my problems one by one. Perhaps one of the biggest issues was getting familiarised with NPM and how to install dependencies -- in hindsight, the struggle was well worth it as I did not have the same problems when I came across NPM later on in my studies. Overall, it was a suitable challenge for the level I was at. It took me a few days to produce and, although it is not the most aesthetic piece of work, I am proud of the end result, especially since it proved that I can produce something of a decent quality when I put my effort into it.

Made using Tailwind CSS. Simple landing page made with HTML, TailwindCSS, and a bit of JS for the dropdown menu and for allowing the user to scroll to a particular section on clicking one of the navigation buttons.

Note: I apologise for the folder named 'DamnIt'. As mentioned above, I became quite frustrated with NPM and the installation process for Tailwind and named the folder out of frustration.
